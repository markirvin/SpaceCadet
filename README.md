# SpaceCadet
Code for an in-the-flesh homebrew version of Space Cadet pinball.

This project will utilize the Mission Pinball Framework (v0.80.0 with GMC) configured for FAST Pinball Neuron-based control hardware.

Phase 1's goal is to add all the games original rules, modes and sounds.
Phase 2's goal is to provide a more modern version (updated rules/modes, multiball, skill shots, etc.) that will be selectable at game start.
